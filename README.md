# Streakinator3000 — Rust + Soroban daily reward streak system

This workspace contains a fun example project showcasing:

- `contracts/` — Soroban smart contract (Rust) implementing daily streaks and rewards.
- `backend/` — Actix-web server (Rust) exposing REST endpoints and integrating with Stellar/Soroban (placeholders/stubs).
- `frontend/` — Yew-based WebAssembly frontend (Rust) scaffold that calls the backend.

This is a playful demo with ASCII art, emojis, and easter eggs (Dragon, Unicorn).

Note: Some integrations (actual Soroban RPC calls and Stellar transfers) are stubbed or simplified because those require network keys and detailed SDK usage.
